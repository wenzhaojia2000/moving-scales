# `moving-scales`

This is a JavaScript animation of coins appearing on the scale balances and causing the scale to move its balances. This animation was present in the original homepage of [Smug energy](https://smug.energy/) before it was removed after a design revamp.

To run the animation, simply open `index.html` in your browser, or visit https://wenzhaojia2000.github.io/scales/.

Here is a very low quality GIF of what the animation looks like.
